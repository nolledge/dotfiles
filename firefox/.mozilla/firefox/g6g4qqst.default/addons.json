Everything can be disabled.\n    Easy for beginners, powerful for advanced users. Not just for Vim fanatics.\n    Modeled after Vimium for Chrome.\n\nNew to VimFx? Check out Questions & Answers!\nPower user? Make a config file!\nIn either case, have look at the the documentation and the wiki.\n\nVimFx is made by these awesome people.\n\nWhy VimFx was created\n\n    Even before Vimium there was Vimperator for Firefox. In my opinion, Vimperator has too many features and aggressively changes the default Firefox appearance and behavior. Vimium is exactly what I need in terms of added functionality, but for Chrome. That’s why I decided to develop similar extension for Firefox.\n\n     VimFx will be nice to your browser and to your habits. Promise.\n\n    – Anton Khodakivskiy, VimFx’s original author.\n\n\nKey Features\nVimFx has concise shortcuts for most commonly performed actions. Many simply invoke native Firefox features. That is preferred over re-implementing similar functionality.\n\nFollow links, focus text inputs and click buttons using hint markers by pressing f. This command has many variations, for example to copy links or open them in new tabs.\n\nSearch with / and cycle between matches with n and N.\n\nOpen a new tab with t, close it with x. Reopen it again with X. Switch between tabs with J and K, or some of the several other tab commands.\n\nScrolling left/down/up/right: h, j, k, l.\nTop/Bottom: gg, G.\nPage up/down: space, shift-space.\nHalf a page: d, u.\n\nThere are of course many more shortcuts! Press ? to see them all, and then / to search among them. Click on a command or open VimFx’s settings page in the Add-ons Manager to customize the default shortcuts.\n\nYou can temporarily disable VimFx by using Ignore mode. Press i to enter it, and shift-escape to exit. Use the blacklist to automatically enter Ignore mode on specific sites.\n\nFeedback\nEnjoying VimFx? Write a review!\n\nFound a bug?
